# üèó Architecture Design for SimIaC

This document outlines the architecture of SimIaC (Simulated Infrastructure as Code), detailing the interaction between the frontend, backend, and IaC script generation components.

## üé® Frontend (Simulated Console)

- **Technology Stack**: Utilize [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.

- **Functionality**: The frontend serves as a simulated console where users can interactively choose and configure cloud resources. It provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the complexity of cloud configurations.

- **Communication**: The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs or WebSockets, ensuring real-time data exchange and responsiveness.

### Key Features:

- Interactive resource selection and configuration.
- Real-time feedback and visualizations of cloud infrastructure.
- Intuitive navigation and user experience.

## üîß Backend (API Interactions and Logic)

- **Technology Stack**: Build the backend using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

- **API Interaction**: The backend is responsible for interfacing with cloud providers' APIs, abstracting this complexity from the frontend while fetching necessary data for resource provisioning.

- **Business Logic**: Processes user inputs, simulates resource provisioning based on the selected configurations, and prepares data for IaC script generation.

### Key Features:

- Efficient API communication with cloud providers.
- Robust processing and transformation of user inputs.
- Generation and management of IaC script generation requests.

## üìÑ IaC Script Generation

- **Template Engine**: Leverage [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) for Python or [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for JavaScript to dynamically generate IaC scripts based on user configurations.

- **Script Formats**: Focus initially on popular IaC languages like Terraform or CloudFormation, with plans to expand based on user feedback.

- **Storage and Retrieval**: Provide mechanisms for users to download generated scripts or directly copy them to the clipboard for deployment purposes.

### Key Features:

- Dynamic generation of accurate and ready-to-use IaC scripts.
- Support for multiple IaC languages and cloud providers.
- User-friendly retrieval and download of generated scripts.
